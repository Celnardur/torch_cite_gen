<h3>Introducing Quicklime</h3>

I'm creating a new programming language called Quicklime!
I think it is pretty awesome and you should too.
Here I summarize some of its features.

<h3>Why create a new programming language?</h3>

It's a greate learning experience and I think it's fun so why not.
Also, I would love to use my own programming language to do something cool.
Making a gmae using it would sure be interesting.
However, the biggest project would be bootstrapping the compiler.

<h3>All done!</h3>

Goodby!
